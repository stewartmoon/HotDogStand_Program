# HotDogStand_Program
Module-7, page 323 #4

You operate several hot dog stands discributed throught town.  Define a class named HOTDOGSTAND that has a member variable for the hot dog stand's ID number and a member variable for how many hot dogs the stand sold that day.  Create a constructor that allows a user of the class to initialize both values.

Also create a functino namerd JUSTSOLD that incremenents the number of hot dogs the stand has sold by one.  This functin will be invoked each time the stand sells a hot dog so that you can track thje total number of hot dogs sold by the stand.  Add another function that returns the number of hot dogs sold.

Finally, add a static variable that tracks the total number of hot dogs sold by all hot dog stands and a STATIC function that returns the value in this variable.  Write a MAIN function tom test your class with at least three hot dog stands that each sell a variaty of hot dogs.
